# TransportationProblem

Consider the following items in the inventory

| name| profit | space |
| --  | ------ | ----- |
| ac  |   23   |  0.1  |
| tv  |   45   |  0.2  |
| tv2 |   23   |  0.1  |
|phone|   11   |  0.3  |
| fan |   11   |  0.5  |

The goal is to select items from this inventory and load it into a transport.
This puts a space constraint on selection. However, the untimate objective is to maximize the profit.

In this repository, Greedy and Genetic Algorithm is employed to solve this optimization problem.
